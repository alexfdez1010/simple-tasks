# Design system

> **Required first step:** complete this document before implementing product
> features or introducing new UI patterns. Replace every `[Fill in]` value,
> remove this notice when the system is approved, and keep later decisions here.

This document is the single source of truth for the product's visual language,
interaction model, and component decisions. It complements HeroUI; it does not
replace HeroUI's accessible primitives.

## 1. Product foundation

- Product name: [Fill in]
- One-sentence promise: [Fill in]
- Primary audience: [Fill in]
- Key user needs: [Fill in]
- Brand personality: [Fill in]
- Words and patterns to avoid: [Fill in]

## 2. Visual direction

- Design principles, in priority order: [Fill in]
- Reference products or visual inspirations: [Fill in]
- What makes this product recognisable: [Fill in]
- Density: [Fill in: compact, balanced, or spacious]
- Shape language: [Fill in: sharp, soft, or mixed]

## 3. Foundations

### Color

Define semantic tokens, not component-specific colors.

| Token        | Light value | Dark value | Usage              |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| `background` | [Fill in]   | [Fill in]  | App canvas         |
| `foreground` | [Fill in]   | [Fill in]  | Primary text       |
| `surface`    | [Fill in]   | [Fill in]  | Cards and panels   |
| `accent`     | [Fill in]   | [Fill in]  | Primary action     |
| `muted`      | [Fill in]   | [Fill in]  | Secondary text     |
| `danger`     | [Fill in]   | [Fill in]  | Destructive states |

Contrast requirements: [Fill in]

### Typography

- Display family and weights: [Fill in]
- Body family and weights: [Fill in]
- Code family: [Fill in]
- Type scale: [Fill in]
- Line-height rules: [Fill in]
- Maximum readable line length: [Fill in]

### Spacing, shape, and elevation

- Base spacing unit: [Fill in]
- Spacing scale: [Fill in]
- Border radii: [Fill in]
- Border treatment: [Fill in]
- Shadow/elevation levels: [Fill in]
- Focus ring treatment: [Fill in]

### Motion

- Motion principles: [Fill in]
- Duration scale: [Fill in]
- Easing curves: [Fill in]
- Reduced-motion behavior: [Fill in]

## 4. Component system

Use HeroUI v3 components first. Document any wrapper or new primitive before
adding it to the codebase.

| Component/pattern | HeroUI primitive | Approved variants | Usage guidance |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Button            | `Button`         | [Fill in]         | [Fill in]      |
| Link              | `Link`           | [Fill in]         | [Fill in]      |
| Card              | `Card`           | [Fill in]         | [Fill in]      |
| Form field        | [Fill in]        | [Fill in]         | [Fill in]      |
| Feedback          | [Fill in]        | [Fill in]         | [Fill in]      |

Component rules:

- Composition rule: [Fill in]
- Loading and pending states: [Fill in]
- Empty states: [Fill in]
- Error states: [Fill in]
- Destructive actions: [Fill in]
- Responsive behavior: [Fill in]

## 5. Accessibility and content

- Keyboard interaction expectations: [Fill in]
- Screen-reader and semantic HTML requirements: [Fill in]
- Minimum contrast target: [Fill in]
- Localization and text expansion rules: [Fill in]
- Voice and tone: [Fill in]
- Content examples: [Fill in]

## 6. Layout and responsive behavior

- Container widths: [Fill in]
- Breakpoints: [Fill in]
- Navigation behavior by breakpoint: [Fill in]
- Mobile-first exceptions: [Fill in]
- Table/data-density strategy: [Fill in]

## 7. Decision log

Record meaningful deviations from HeroUI defaults or previously approved
patterns.

| Date         | Decision  | Reason    | Owner     |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Fill in] | [Fill in] | [Fill in] |

## 8. Review checklist

- [ ] All `[Fill in]` placeholders are resolved.
- [ ] Tokens are semantic and have light/dark values where needed.
- [ ] Keyboard, focus, contrast, and reduced-motion behavior are defined.
- [ ] Approved HeroUI primitives and variants are listed.
- [ ] A representative page has been checked at mobile and desktop widths.
- [ ] The team has approved this document before feature implementation.
